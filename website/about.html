    <h3 class="caption">UX Designer/Programmer</h3>
    <p>I created the program's interface and also designed this website. I code time to time and my previous incarnations of the media player were coded directly by me. Previous incarnations include, AniPlayer X (2009), Niko Neko Pureya (2010-2011), and the older version of Baka MPlayer (2012-early 2014). As time went by, my programming skills along with my GUI skills improved and its results have been incorporated into the latest incarnation of the media player. <a href="http://joshuapark.info/">You can visit my website here.</a></p>
